### Collect Additional Logs with YY-Thunks (Optional) 
To provide more detailed information about APIs used by the application, you can use **YY-Thunks**:  
1. Download **YY-Thunks** from the official release page (https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/YY-Thunks/releases)
2. Run the following command in a terminal, replacing `D:\Tool\SomeProgram.exe` with the path to your application:  
   ```  
   YY.Depends.Analyzer.exe "D:\Tool\SomeProgram.exe" /IgnoreReady /ReportView:Table /Target:6.1.7600  
   ```
